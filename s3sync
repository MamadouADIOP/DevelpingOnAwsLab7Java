       redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket
       or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the
       object metadata.

       [1m--content-type [22m(string) Specify an explicit content type for this oper-
       ation. This value overrides any guessed mime types.

       [1m--source-region [22m(string) When transferring objects from an s3 bucket to
       an s3 bucket, this specifies the region of the source bucket. Note  the
       region specified by [1m--region [22mor through configuration of the CLI refers
       to the region of the destination  bucket.  If  [1m--source-region  [22mis  not
       specified  the  region  of the source will be the same as the region of
       the destination bucket.

       [1m--only-show-errors [22m(boolean) Only errors and  warnings  are  displayed.
       All other output is suppressed.

       [1m--metadata  [22m(map)  A  map  of metadata to store with the objects in S3.
       This will be applied to every object which is part of this request.  In
       a  sync,  this means that files which haven't changed won't receive the
       new metadata. key -> (string)
          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

            ...}

       [1m--copy-props [22m(string) Determines which properties are copied  from  the
       source  S3  object.  This  parameter  only applies for S3 to S3 copies.
       Valid values are:

          +o [1mnone [22m- Do not copy any  of  the  properties  from  the  source  S3
            object.

          +o [1mmetadata-directive  [22m-  Copies  the  following  properties from the
            source S3 object: [1mcontent-type[22m,  [1mcontent-language[22m,  [1mcontent-encod-[0m
            [1ming[22m, [1mcontent-disposition[22m, [1mcache-control[22m, [1m--expires[22m, and [1mmetadata[0m

          +o [1mdefault  [22m-  The  default value. Copies tags and properties covered
            under the [1mmetadata-directive [22mvalue from the source S3 object.

          In order to copy the appropriate properties  for  multipart  copies,
          some  of the options may require additional API calls if a multipart
          copy is involved. Specifically:

          +o [1mmetadata-directive [22mmay require additional [1mHeadObject [22mAPI calls.

          +o [1mdefault [22mmay require additional [1mHeadObject[22m,  [1mGetObjectTagging[22m,  and
            [1mPutObjectTagging  [22mAPI  calls. Note this list of API calls may grow
            in the future in order to ensure  multipart  copies  preserve  the
            exact properties a [1mCopyObject [22mAPI call would preserve.

          If you want to guarantee no additional API calls are made other than
          than the ones needed to perform the actual copy, set this option  to
          [1mnone[22m.

       [1m--metadata-directive  [22m(string) Sets the [1mx-amz-metadata-directive [22mheader
       for CopyObject operations. It is recommended to  use  the  [1m--copy-props[0m
       parameter instead to control copying of metadata properties. If [1m--meta-[0m
       [1mdata-directive [22mis set, the [1m--copy-props [22mparameter will be disabled  and
       will have no affect on the transfer.

       [1m--size-only [22m(boolean) Makes the size of each key the only criteria used
       to decide whether to sync from source to destination.

       [1m--exact-timestamps [22m(boolean) When syncing from S3 to local,  same-sized
       items  will  be  ignored  only  when  the timestamps match exactly. The
       default behavior is to ignore same-sized items unless the local version
       is newer than the S3 version.

       [1m--delete  [22m(boolean)  Files that exist in the destination but not in the
       source are deleted during sync. Note that files excluded by filters are
       excluded from deletion.

[1mGLOBAL OPTIONS[0m

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       [1m--no-verify-ssl [22m(boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       [1m--no-paginate [22m(boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       [1m--cli-read-timeout [22m(int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       [1m--cli-connect-timeout [22m(int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

       [1m--cli-binary-format [22m(string)

       The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is
       base64.  The  base64  format  expects  binary blobs to be provided as a
       base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves  compati-
       bility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed liter-
       ally. When providing contents from a file that map  to  a  binary  blob
       [1mfileb://  [22mwill  always  be  treated as binary and use the file contents
       directly  regardless  of  the  [1mcli-binary-format  [22msetting.  When  using
       [1mfile://  [22mthe file contents will need to properly formatted for the con-

       local file will require uploading if the size of the local file is dif-
       ferent than the size of the S3 object, the last modified  time  of  the
       local  file  is  newer than the last modified time of the S3 object, or
       the local file does not exist under the specified  bucket  and  prefix.
       In  this  example, the user syncs the bucket [1mmybucket [22mto the local cur-
       rent  directory.   The  local  current  directory  contains  the  files
       [1mtest.txt [22mand [1mtest2.txt[22m.  The bucket [1mmybucket [22mcontains no objects.

          aws s3 sync . s3://mybucket

       Output:

          upload: test.txt to s3://mybucket/test.txt
          upload: test2.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       [1mExample  2: Sync all S3 objects from the specified S3 bucket to another[0m
       [1mbucket[0m

       The following [1msync [22mcommand syncs objects under a specified  prefix  and
       bucket  to objects under another specified prefix and bucket by copying
       S3 objects. An S3 object will require copying if the sizes of  the  two
       S3  objects  differ, the last modified time of the source is newer than
       the last modified time of the destination, or the S3  object  does  not
       exist under the specified bucket and prefix destination.

       In  this  example,  the  user  syncs  the bucket [1mmybucket [22mto the bucket
       [1mmybucket2[22m. The  bucket  [1mmybucket  [22mcontains  the  objects  [1mtest.txt  [22mand
       [1mtest2.txt[22m. The bucket [1mmybucket2 [22mcontains no objects:

          aws s3 sync s3://mybucket s3://mybucket2

       Output:

          copy: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket2/test.txt
          copy: s3://mybucket/test2.txt to s3://mybucket2/test2.txt

       [1mExample  3:  Sync  all  S3  objects from the specified S3 bucket to the[0m
       [1mlocal directory[0m

       The following [1msync [22mcommand syncs files from the specified S3 bucket  to
       the  local  directory  by  downloading  S3  objects.  An S3 object will
       require downloading if the size of the S3 object differs from the  size
       of  the  local  file,  the last modified time of the S3 object is newer
       than the last modified time of the local file, or the  S3  object  does
       not exist in the local directory. Take note that when objects are down-
       loaded from S3, the last modified time of the local file is changed  to
       the  last  modified  time  of  the S3 object. In this example, the user
       syncs the bucket [1mmybucket [22mto the current local  directory.  The  bucket
       [1mmybucket  [22mcontains  the  objects  [1mtest.txt  [22mand [1mtest2.txt[22m.  The current
       local directory has no files:

          aws s3 sync s3://mybucket .

       Output:

          download: s3://mybucket/test.txt to test.txt
          download: s3://mybucket/test2.txt to test2.txt

       [1mall files that do not match[0m

       The  following  [1msync [22mcommand syncs objects under a specified prefix and
       bucket to files in a local directory by uploading the  local  files  to
       S3.   Because  of  the [1m--delete [22mparameter, any files existing under the
       specified prefix and bucket but not existing  in  the  local  directory
       will  be  deleted.  In this example, the user syncs the bucket [1mmybucket[0m
       to the local current directory.  The local current  directory  contains
       the  files  [1mtest.txt  [22mand  [1mtest2.txt[22m.  The bucket [1mmybucket [22mcontains the
       object [1mtest3.txt[22m:

       The  following  [1msync [22mcommand syncs objects under a specified prefix and
       bucket to files in a local directory by uploading the  local  files  to
       S3.  Because of the [1m--exclude [22mparameter, all files matching the pattern
       existing both in S3 and locally will be excluded from the sync. In this
       example, the user syncs the bucket [1mmybucket [22mto the local current direc-
       tory.  The local current directory  contains  the  files  [1mtest.jpg  [22mand
       [1mtest2.txt[22m.   The bucket [1mmybucket [22mcontains the object [1mtest.jpg [22mof a dif-

       The  following  [1msync  [22mcommand  syncs  files  under a local directory to
       objects under a specified prefix and bucket by downloading S3  objects.
       This  example  uses the [1m--exclude [22mparameter flag to exclude a specified
       directory and S3 prefix from the [1msync [22mcommand.  In  this  example,  the
       user  syncs  the  local  current directory to the bucket [1mmybucket[22m.  The
       local   current   directory   contains   the   files    [1mtest.txt    [22mand
